The Running Tracker App is designed to help users track their daily running distances. The app allows users to log their running distances for each day of the week, calculate the weekly average distance, and view detailed information about each day's running activity (morning and afternoon). The app also supports edge-to-edge UI for a modern user experience, including handling window insets to adapt to different screen sizes and notch placements.
